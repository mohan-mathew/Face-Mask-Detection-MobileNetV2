Corona Virus Disease **(COVID-19)** pandemic is causing a health crisis. One of the effective methods against the virus is wearing a face mask. This project introduces face mask detection that can be used by the authorities to make mitigation, evaluation, prevention, and action planning against COVID-19. 


The face mask recognition in this study is developed with a machine learning algorithm through the image classification method: **MobileNetV2.**

The steps for building the model are collecting the data, pre-processing, split the data, testing the model, and implement the model.
The built model can detect people who are wearing a face mask and not wearing it at an accuracy of 92.85 percent.
After the model implemented in 25 cities from various source of image, the percentage of people wearing face mask in the cities has a strong correlation to the vigilance index of **COVID-19** which is 0,62.
